** LSP-Modes

Support for ~lsp-html~ and ~lsp-css~ is avaible. To use, make sure you install
the packages ~vscode-languageserver-bin~ and ~vscode-languagserver-bin~ via
either

NPM
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
npm install vscode-languagserver-bin # you can use the -g option if you'd prefer
#+END_SRC

Yarn
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
yarn add vscode-languageserver-bin # pass 'global' before 'add' if you want to install globally
#+END_SRC

or [[https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm][pnpm]].
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
pnpm install vscode-languageserver-bin # same with npm, -g pass if you prefer
#+END_SRC

** Something to note
/Date of writing this:/ [2018-08-20 Mon]

When configuring the ~lsp-css~ package I (The-BigDaddy) ran into a lot issues
which involved the error 

~Warning (lsp-mode): Couldnâ€™t find project root, using the current directory as the root.~  

To avoid this, there needs to be a ~package.json~ in on of the parent
directories (your ~$HOME~ doesn't count) of wherever you create a css/scss/or
sass file or html file. These lsp-modes require it to determine you projects
root, which I find a little odd but that's how it is for now.
